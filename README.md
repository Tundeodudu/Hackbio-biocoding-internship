Project Overview
This repository contains code generated for the HackBio Biocoding internship program. The code was created to organize and display information about Team Arginine02 members.

Team Members
Abisola Olaleye
Latifatu Mohammed
Naomi Ogoke
Babatunde Owoloye
Ganobi Chinwe

Project Details
- Programming Language: Python
- Project Type: Information Repository
- Related Project: HackBio Biocoding internship program

Code Generation Steps
1. Data Collection: Team member information was collected, including names, Slack usernames, email addresses, hobbies, countries of origin, disciplines, and preferred programming languages.
2. Data Organization: The collected data was organized into a Python dictionary, with each team member's information stored as a separate dictionary entry.
3. Code Writing: The Python code was written to define the Teamarginine02_info dictionary and print its contents.
4. Code Review: The code was reviewed for accuracy, readability, and consistency.

Code Structure
The code consists of a single Python script that defines the team member information and prints its contents. The information is stored in the following variables:
